**Seed Creation Commands**
--------------------------------------------

**!rando** - rolls a seed with light randomization. Perfect for quick pick-up-and-go runs.
**!chaos** - if you like your flagsets to be a little more wacky, this one's for you! Much more liberal randomization can lead to some really interesting settings.
**!true_chaos** - this one randomizes... literally everything... with no weighting whatsoever. Test your FF6WC skill and knowledge... and your patience!
**!rollseed <flagset>** - rolls a seed from the specified flagset
**!devseed <flagset>** - rolls your seed using a dev version of the randomizer (use **!devhelp** for more info)
**!preset <name>** - rolls a seed from a user-preset flagset (use **!presethelp** for more info)

--------------------------------------------
